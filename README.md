## Topics
The following is a list of some of the concepts that will be implemented:

* Distributed Configuration (using [Spring Cloud Config](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/))
* API Gateways (using [Netflix Zuul](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/multi/multi__router_and_filter_zuul.html))
* API Versioning

These concepts will be extended as the project evolves.

## Build and Run (Docker)
```./dev.sh```
